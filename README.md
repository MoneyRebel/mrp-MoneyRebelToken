# Bug bounty rules

We will reward bug bounty for bugs found at three levels, according to the severity of the bug discovered. 

1. Critical:
We will reward you with a bounty of 10k EUR (in ETH currency, at time of reward transfer)
Critical bugs include bugs that enable destroying, taking over or stealing the tokens

2. Moderate:
We will reward you with a bounty of 3k EUR (in ETH currency, at time of reward transfer)
Moderate bugs include bugs that will bring out wrong results of the contract. For example - burning feature of the contract does not burn the tokens or when, by sending MRP tokens, a wrong amount is sent, etc..

3. Low:
We will reward you with a bounty of 1k EUR (in ETH currency, at time of reward transfer)
Various small bugs that exist in the code.


We reserve the right to decide ourselves the severity of the bug discovered, and at which level we will reward the person who discovers it. 

## Basic rules:
- Bounties go to the first to report on Github
- Bug must be reported with steps to reproduce and all info needed to fix
- Non-security critical issues (style issues, gas optimizations) are not eligible
- Bounty will run until January, 15th 2018
